# Metrics configuration file
metrics:
  # Delta 1 metric
  d1:
    # Maximum number of point after first detection where delta detection delay will be use to compute
    # if detection delay i greater this value will be used as maximum.
    max_search_limit: 30

  # Delta 2 metric
  d2:
    # Additional time added to the max_search_limit value in case of detection delay computation for
    # 'cycle detector' anomaly detection algorithm (STEP5) of the simulation
    tau: 30
  
  # Metric filter used to block specific
  filters:
